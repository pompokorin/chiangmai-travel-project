            <h2>Why Chiang Mai?</h2>
            <h3>Chiang Mai, the hub of Nothern Thailand</h3>
            <p>
              Founded in 1296 CE, Chiang Mai is a culturally and historically
              interesting city, at one time the capital of the ancient Lanna
              kingdom. In the rolling foothills of the Himalayas 700 km north of
              Bangkok, until the 1920s it could only be reached by an arduous
              river journey or an elephant trek. This isolation helped preserve
              Chiang Mai's distinctive charm, which remains intact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Chiang Mai's historical centre is the walled city. The sections of
              the wall dating to their restoration a few decades ago remain at
              the gates and corners, but of the rest only the moat remains.
              Inside Chiang Mai's remaining city walls are more than 30 temples
              dating back to the founding of the principality, in a combination
              of Burmese, Sri Lankan, and Lanna Thai styles, decorated with
              beautiful wood carvings, Naga staircases, leonine and angelic
              guardians, gilded umbrellas and pagodas laced with gold filigree.
              Modern-day Chiang Mai has expanded in all directions, but
              particularly to the east to the banks of the Ping River (Mae Nam
              Ping), where Changklan Rd, the famous Night Bazaar, and the bulk
              of Chiang Mai's hotels and guest houses are located.
